title: Workshop on Collaborative and Participatory Modeling 2024
email: copamo2024@easychair.org
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
 Collaborative modeling is an important enabler to engineering complex systems. While mostly focusing on the technical and technological aspects of 
 collaboration, the MDE community has also recognized the need for more pronounced stakeholder-facing concerns in collaborative modeling techniques 
 and tools. Such stakeholder-facing concerns are the ones researched under the broader participatory modeling umbrella. This workshop aims to showcase
  the latest developments in Collaborative and Participatory Modeling, as well as to expose the synergies between collaborative and participatory
   modeling by inviting researchers and organizers from both communities.
