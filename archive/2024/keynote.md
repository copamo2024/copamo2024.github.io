<h1>Automating, Evaluating, and Broadening Participatory Modeling and Simulation</h1>
<b>Speaker</b>: [Dr. Philippe Giabbanelli](https://giabbanelli.com/author/philippe-j.-giabbanelli/) (Virginia Modeling, Analysis & Simulation Center; Old Dominion University, USA)

<b>Abstract</b>: Modeling a complex phenomenon benefits from the participation of subject matter experts (SMEs), who can identify relevant constructs and mechanisms within the problem space. While traditional participatory modeling studies have long relied on involving SMEs through in-person workshops, this approach had several bottlenecks: SMEs may not be available at the same time in the same physical location, and trained facilitators are a scarce resource. In this talk, we explore emerging technologies that allow modelers to automatically elicit and structure knowledge from participants, assess its validity, and combine it to obtain comprehensive graph-based models (e.g., causal loop diagrams). As the most appropriate formalism depends on context, task and stakeholders, we also examine situations in which existing participatory models from one formalism may need to be ported into another formalism or transformed into a different abstraction level, thus promoting effective reuse of participatory models instead of repeatedly (and unnecessarily) tapping into expert knowledge.
